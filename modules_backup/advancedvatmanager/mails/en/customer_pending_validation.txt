VAT validation system has failed

Hi [/{customer_name}],

Your VAT number [/{vat}] has not been validated because the shop's API system has failed. As soon as the system is restored, we will validate your VAT number and the order with reference [/{order_reference] will be able to be processed correctly.

We are sorry for the inconvenience caused.
