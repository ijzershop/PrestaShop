Feature: Currency Management
  PrestaShop allows BO users to manage customers in the Customers > Customers page
  As a BO user
  I must be able to create, save and edit customers

  Background:
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists

  Scenario: Adding new currency
    When I add new currency "currency1" with following properties:
      | iso_code         | EUR   |
      | exchange_rate    | 0.88  |
      | is_enabled       | true  |
      | shop_association | shop1 |
    Then currency "currency1" should be "EUR"
    And currency "currency1" exchange rate should be 0.88
    And currency "currency1" should have status enabled
    And currency "currency1" should be available in shop "shop1"

  Scenario: Disabling default currency should not be allowed
    Given currency "currency2" with "USD" exists
    And currency "currency2" is default in "shop1" shop
    When I disable currency "currency2"
    Then I should get error that default currency cannot be disabled
